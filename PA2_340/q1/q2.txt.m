% For DataSet1
% Basis Function Choice: Trigonometric
% Justification: The given dataset seems to exhibit periodic behavior, making trigonometric functions suitable for interpolation and approximation.
% Trigonometric functions can effectively capture periodic patterns present in the data.

% For DataSet2
% Basis Function Choice: Polynomial
% Justification: The dataset does not appear to have clear periodic behavior. 
% Polynomial functions can be used since it provides flexibility to capture 
% complex shapes in the data.

% For DataSet1
% Justification for Interpolation:
% The data in Dataset 1 appears to be sampled from a continuous function with no missing values or noise.
% Interpolation is suitable here to reconstruct the underlying function accurately at the given data points.

% For DataSet2
% Justification for Approximation:
% Dataset 2 contains some noise and irregularities, suggesting that an approximation model might 
% be more robust in capturing the overall trend while smoothing out small variations. 
% Approximation is suitable here to generalize the underlying pattern of the data.
