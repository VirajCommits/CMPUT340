Sure, let's walk through a dry run of the provided `myLU` function using the example input matrix `A`:

```matlab
A = [4, 3, 2;
     8, 7, 6;
     12, 11, 10];
```

Step 1 (Iteration 1 - k=1):
- `k = 1`, so we are working on the first column of `U`.
- Initially, `L` is an identity matrix and `U` is a copy of `A`.

After the first iteration of the loop:
- We call `elimMat(U, 1)` to calculate elimination matrices and multipliers for the first column of `U` to make it upper triangular.
- The elimination matrices and multipliers, denoted as `temp_M` and `temp_L`, are calculated to eliminate values below the pivot element `U(1,1)`.

```
temp_M =
     1     0     0
    -2     1     0
    -3     0     1

temp_L =
    1.0000         0         0
    2.0000    1.0000         0
    3.0000         0    1.0000
```

- We update `L` by multiplying it with `temp_L`, and `U` is updated by multiplying it with `temp_M`.

After the first iteration:
- `L` becomes `temp_L`, which is:
```
L =
     1     0     0
     2     1     0
     3     0     1
```

- `U` becomes `temp_M * U`, which is:
```
U =
     4     3     2
     0     1     2
     0     2     4
```

Step 2 (Iteration 2 - k=2):
- In the second iteration, `k = 2`, so we are working on the second column of `U`.
- We repeat the same process as in the first iteration.

After the second iteration:
- We calculate `temp_M` and `temp_L` for the second column of `U` to eliminate values below the pivot `U(2,2)`.

```
temp_M =
     1     0
     0     1

temp_L =
    1.0000         0
         0    1.0000
```

- We update `L` and `U` as follows:
  - `L` becomes the product of `L` and `temp_L`, which is unchanged.
  - `U` becomes the product of `temp_M` and the current `U`.

After the second iteration:
- `L` remains the same:
```
L =
     1     0     0
     2     1     0
     3     0     1
```

- `U` becomes:
```
U =
     4     3     2
     0     1     2
     0     0     0
```

The loop terminates since `k` reaches the maximum value of `n-1`.

At this point, `L` contains the lower triangular part of the LU decomposition, and `U` contains the upper triangular part. So, the LU decomposition of the input matrix `A` is:

```
L =
     1     0     0
     2     1     0
     3     0     1

U =
     4     3     2
     0     1     2
     0     0     0
```

This demonstrates the LU decomposition of the input matrix `A` using the `myLU` function with two iterations of the loop.
