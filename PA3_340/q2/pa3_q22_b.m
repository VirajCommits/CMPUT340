% When the target point is distant from the end effector, especially beyond the robot's reachable workspace,
% achieving direct convergence using methods such as Newton's can be quite challenging. To tackle this scenario,
% consider adopting a path planning approach.

% 1. Path Planning: Instead of directly aiming for the distant target, strategize a path comprising intermediate
%    points. This path might constitute a straight line or a curved trajectory, like a Bezier curve or spline,
%    starting from the current position of the end effector and extending towards the target. Ensure this path is
%    planned well within the robot's reachable workspace.

% 2. Intermediate Points: Break down the planned path into multiple shorter segments, each represented by an
%    intermediate point. It's crucial to position these points in close proximity to ensure that movement from one
%    point to the next remains within the robot's operational capabilities.

% 3. Reaching the Target: In scenarios where the target lies outside the reachable workspace, consider maneuvering
%    the robot towards the nearest feasible point within its operational range. If needed, re-evaluate or adjust the
%    target position to ensure its feasibility within the reachable workspace.
